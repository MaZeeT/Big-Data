    "# Marketing Mix Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will look at Marketing Mix Models as an example of the usage of linear regression in Business Intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task: *We want to model sales (or another KPI such as number of customers, leads, etc.) as a function of advertising, trends, events, seasonality, price, distribution, macro-economic factors, the weather etc.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "* For offline medias (traditional medias such TV, Radio, outdoor banners etc.), it can be really hard to measure the effect of marketing on sales, because we never know when people buy a product, whether they do it (partly) because they saw a TV ad. (We can measure some of it with special discount codes, however.)\n",
    "* The different variables comes with different controls from our side\n",
    "    + Seasonality, macro-economic factors and the weather, we cannot control\n",
    "    + Price and distribution can be controlled to some extend\n",
    "    + Advertising is where we have the most control\n",
    "* With such a model, we can evaluate marketing campaigns and plan future campaign based on which marketing mix that we predicted to generate most sales\n",
    "* A classical approach is to use some sort of Linear Regression.\n",

Thus to use the filter function from base R we use `stats::filter` as filter in base R is located in a package called `stats`. This syntax can also be used for other packages, so we could just write `dplyr::filter` when we want to use the filter function we have previously used instead of loading the package `tidyverse` (which the package `dplyr` is part of).\n",
