# Big Data and Business Intelligence
This is my submission of the "Big Data and Business Intelligence" course exam project from RUC (Roskilde University).
A description of the course can be found in CourseDescription.pdf

The submission is consist of the notebook AKUT&HA-2018-2020, where I clean and explore a dataset based on blood samples from a local hospital. I need up making some suggestions to actions that could be taken based on the findings. Other notebooks and files do not relate to the submission but the course in general.
